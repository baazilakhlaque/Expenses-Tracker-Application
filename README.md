# Expenses Tracker Application

This is a classic expenses tracker application built using React.js, which allows users to keep track of the items they bought, their expenses, and the purchasing dates. Users can then filter the results by year to check what their total expenditures for the year were, and the items they bought each month for that year. 
This project allowed me to learn the basics of React and how React components work with each other.

How to run:
- Git clone the repository
- Go into the project directory
- Run "npm install"
- Then run "npm start"
